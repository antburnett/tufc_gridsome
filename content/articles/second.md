## Update

To all our Turramurra United members,

I would like to provide you with an update about the start of the 2020 football season. Firstly, I would like to say that I hope that each of you and your families are all keeping well during this unprecedented time.

The news is that the start of the 2020 football season has been postponed by the NSFA until early May. This is disappointing for everyone who wants to get out on the pitch and play but is realistic given the current situation. As a club, TUFC is supportive of the NSFA decision and will abide by it. Given the nature of the coronavirus and the constantly changing goal posts, we promise to keep you up to date with any further decisions NSFA or FFA make about the 2020 season.

Nevertheless, the volunteer TUFC committee members are still preparing for the upcoming season. Most of our teams have been formed and the details sent out. We have packed countless kit bags and have been working on training allocations with our training partners, T3 Australia and XLR8. For those still waiting for your team lists, the details will be sent out soon.

Many of our teams still need volunteer managers and game-day coaches. If you want to help, please email Anita, our secretary at secretary@turramurraunited.com.au. We will either hold a coaches and managers meeting or send out an information pack closer to kick off for the season.

Our Club Coaching Coordinator and I are speaking with our training partners to look at ways to provide links to online skills tips and training options for players and their parents. Whilst we explore this option, we encourage players to keep their football going at home, in the back yard or on a run. Both XLR8 and T3 have great online resources which we will provide links to, so it is worthwhile accessing those to keep up the skills.

As the COVID-19 situation unfolds, we acknowledge that this will impact everyone in many ways, but we encourage everyone to keep their registrations intact. TUFC will not be issuing any fee refunds at this point in time, given the goalposts may move on us yet again in the next 6 weeks. Once the season does get underway and we know how many weeks it will cover, or in the worst-case scenario when we are informed of its cancellation, we can determine, if required, an equitable basis for any fee refunds.

As the new TUFC president for 2020, this is certainly not the welcome to 2020 communication I was planning to send. However, as a committee of volunteers and responsible citizens, we have to be guided by our football governing bodies, the FFA and NSFA, and, of course our governments. To keep in touch with the latest TUFC news, please like our Instagram and Facebook pages.

I am looking forward to seeing you all on the pitch, hopefully in May, and wish you good luck for the upcoming football season.

Kylie Chambers
TUFC President
