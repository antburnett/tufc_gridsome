As you may be aware from January 2018, the NSW Government will provide $100 through a voucher system for parents to contribute to the cost of their children’s participation in sport and active recreation. A voucher can be redeemed towards payment of membership or fees with an approved provider registered with the Active Kids program, once each calendar year for each school-enrolled child.  This program is effective from 31st January 2018, and therefore, registrations for Turramurra United FC will not open until **1st February 2018**, in order to ensure a smooth process for redeeming vouchers when parents register their child or children with the club.

**How to apply for vouchers and redeem them when registering for football:**
