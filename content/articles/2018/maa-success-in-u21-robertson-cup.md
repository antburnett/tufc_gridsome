The Turramurra United Men's All Age side headed down to the Sutherland shire to compete in the quarter finals of the NSW U21 Robertson Cup.

They faced a tough contest, however, with only 12 players available to play, with most backing up from the league match the previous day.Â  So the boys took to the field knowing a tough contest awaited them.

The entire 90 minutes was fuelled by grit and determination as the back line and midfield held firm, not letting the Barden Ridgebacks get a clean sight at all. Meanwhile, at the other end the trademark counterattacks led by Jamie Woods resulted in two goals for the away side in the second half. The first by latching onto a through ball, rounding an opposition player and tucking it away, and the second pouncing off a rebound after the keeper saved a shot from Bailey Allain.

Onto the semi-finals now, as the lads look to claim the title of the best U21 side in NSW!
