Their Beautiful Game was first established in 2009 to assist schools, football clubs and their players in impoverished areas.Â  Since 2009, thousands of boots, hundreds of balls, dozens of team kits and stacks of training equipment has been collected and donated to:

- indigenous communities in remote parts of Australia
- homeless and refugee football teams in urban Sydney
- support footballers as far afield as Brazil, India, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Kenya, Cambodia and Thailand.
