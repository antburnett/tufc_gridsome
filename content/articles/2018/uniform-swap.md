_Update: we'll be at Bannockburn today (Friday 6) between_ 5pm _and_ 6pm _for last minute gear swaps._

Training is split between Karuah Park and Bannockburn Oval. With the first training sessions happening this week, the uniform is being handed out by managers and coaches.

Please note that currently, we do not have any Turramurra United shorts, socks or playing shirts at Karuah.

If you need to swap sizes or collect gear this can be done at _Bannockburn Oval_ this afternoon from 4:30 p.m. or next week (times to be advised).
