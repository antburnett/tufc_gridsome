Look how fabulous these kids from Ghana look in our superceded Wahroonga FC and Bannockburn Kit!

Many thanks to [Their Beautiful Game](https://www.theirbeautifulgame.org/) and [Turramurra Bendigo Bank](https://turramurraunited.com.au/sponsors/business-partners/bendigo-bank/) for arranging the donation. The smiles on the kids are just beautiful.
