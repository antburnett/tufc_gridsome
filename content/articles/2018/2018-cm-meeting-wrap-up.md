Thanks to all the Coaches and Managers who attended the meeting last night at Turramurra Bowling Club. It was a free-flowing affair, with lots of tips and tricks for the new officials from Co-presidents Geoff and Mark.

We don't need 'referees' for Under 6 matches, but 'team leaders'. Experience in herding cats is also an advantage!

Managers were encouraged to get team contact lists of other TUFC teams to help form teams when players fall sick or are away.

Rules about substitutions in the competitive Under 12 and above age groups were outlined.

Managers were made aware of wet weather and ground closures. If you're playing on an artificial surface like North Turramurra Recreation Area, your game will always be on  (except lightning at the ground). For all other matches, please check this website, Facebook, or the NSFA website and you'll find the resource. [Our weather page](https://turramurraunited.com.au/play/weather/) with all the links is here.

The kits were collected, and hopefully, most questions from the floor were answered to your satisfaction.

We have uploaded the [Regulations for the 2018 Season](https://turramurraunited.com.au/coaches-managers/regulations/) (including Miniroos), and information on the Electronic Match Cards in the Coaches and Manager section:
