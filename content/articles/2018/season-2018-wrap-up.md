We hope that everyone had fun at Presentation Day on Sunday. It clearly looked like everyone was enjoying themselves, from the crazy photos in the photo booth (courtesy of Chadwick Real Estate), to the jumping around on the bouncy castle and sliding down the slide, to the sausages and burgers being eaten from the BBQ, to the goals being scored in the penalty shoot-out competition and the smiles at the trophy presentations.

Many thanks to all our managers, coaches and volunteers for all their hard work and support this season, which has turned out to be a very special and successful merger.

A special thank you must once again go to our Sponsors - Chadwick Real Estate, LaZana Pizza, Business Plaza and Cardiac Responder and our business partners, Turramurra Sports and Physiotherapy, Wahroonga Village Podiatry and Bendigo Bank Turramurra and Lindfield.

Enjoy the summer and we all look forward to seeing you again in 2019!
