Unfortunately, there has been a problem with Services NSW activating the Turramurra United FC account on the [Active Kids Rebate Program](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/transaction/apply-active-kids-voucher). This means that at the moment the MyFootballClub site will not accept a voucher code when a Turramurra United registration is attempted.

Therefore, we have set up a deferred payment option of -$100 for those of you who have received your voucher code and would like to redeem it when registering your child with Turramurra United. When you register your child, proceed through the registration process until you reach the payment page and then at Step 1 – Additional Items, click on “purchase additional items” and then select Deferred Payment.  This will deduct $100 from your fee.  You can then proceed and pay the discounted amount on-line.  Click here to see a relevant screen shot. Do not enter your voucher code in the voucher code field – at this stage, the system will not accept the code.

If you have used this deferred payment process to have your fee discounted by $100, please email me your Active Kids voucher code asap - [sec@turramurraunited.com.au](mailto:sec@turramurraunited.com.au) so that the club can redeem it with Services NSW.

We hope that Services NSW will rectify this issue very soon. We will advise when they do this and when voucher codes can be entered into the system when registering.
