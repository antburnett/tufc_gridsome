_**THIS SCHEDULE HAS BEEN REVISED AND UPDATED**_

_**Please go to [https://turramurraunited.com.au/2018-training-schedule-updates/](https://turramurraunited.com.au/2018-training-schedule-updates/) for the final schedule.**_

With the joining of two clubs, putting together the training schedule has been a little more complex this season. Several age groups have been split into multiple groups based on the capacity of the training field. Teams within each group are not ranked in any way. Questions concerning which Group you are in can be directed to your Age Manager on the [Contact Page](https://turramurraunited.com.au/contact/). Thank you for your patience!

**Please note training commences 4th April. First games will be 7th April.**
