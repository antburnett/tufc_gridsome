Hi everyone,

As we near the end of our first season as Turramurra United FC we would like to congratulate everyone on a successful and enjoyable season.

Next weekend sees our MiniRoos teams playing in Gala Day.  U6 to U11 mixed MiniRoos will have their Gala Day on Saturday 25th August, and the GU8, GU9 and GU10 have their Gala Day on Sunday 26th August.  The draw should be finalised by NSFA very soon.

T3 training is still on this week for the MiniRoos teams, and XLR8 training will be on for all U11 teams and those teams who are playing in their Final this weekend.

We would like to congratulate all those teams that played in a Semi-Final match last weekend – what a great season you have all had!

The following teams, unfortunately, lost their Semi-Final match.

- U12B
- U12D
- G12A
- U13A

Further congratulations and good luck to the following teams who will be playing their Final this weekend:

- U12C
- U13B
- G14A
- U15A
- U15B
- U18B
- WAAA
- MAA3

Thanks!
