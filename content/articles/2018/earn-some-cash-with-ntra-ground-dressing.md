**UPDATE: this position has now been filled - thank you!**

As a club, Turramurra United FC is responsible for dressing and undressing the two grass fields at North Turramurra Recreation Area, known as NTRA.

Ground dressing involves putting out the goal nets and corner flags on the morning before the first scheduled match. Ground undressing involves bringing in the nets and the corner posts later in the afternoon once matches have completed.

Matches at NTRA are played on both Saturday and Sunday.

The Club isÂ looking for someone to dress and undress NTRA on Saturdays and Sundays for the 2018 season, for which they will be paid a daily rate.

If anyone would be interested in earning some money over the winter please [contact the Club secretary](https://turramurraunited.com.au/contact/) for more information.
