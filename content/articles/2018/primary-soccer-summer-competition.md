Just a reminder to register for Primary Soccer if you are looking to continue playing football during the summer - [www.primarysoccer.com.au](http://www.primarysoccer.com.au)

Primary Soccer is run like a cooperative between many of the clubs in the area. Profits are returned to clubs based on the number of participants. So, when registering, remember to mention our Club (Turramurra United FC). For $150 you can play one afternoon a week at locations like Wahroonga, Turramurra, St Ives for a 15 week season ending in February.

It caters for all ages up to 15 and also has a weekend womenâ€™s competition. All games have qualified referees. Team registrations have begun so now is the time to talk to teammates to get a group of 5 or 6 together. You can register as an individual and be placed in a team or register as a team, players are not graded so you can stay with your friends. Teams are graded so your opponents are of similar ability.

If you wish to enter a team, now is the time to talk to friends and teammates and register at [www.primarysoccer.com.au](http://www.primarysoccer.com.au)
