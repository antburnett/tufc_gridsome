The MAA side travelled down to Henley Park to face Burwood in the round of 16 of the U21 Robertson Cup.

Wearing the new alternate kit the boys started poorly with a mix up in defence resulting in Burwood taking an early lead. However, Turramurra bounced back with their pace upfront allowing them to nip in behind the opposition defence time after time. This led to numerous chances being created. Bailey Allain eventually opened the scoring with a smart finish round the keeper. Then followed a flurry of goals with Miles Dingle grabbing 2 and Nick Pogonowski rounding out the second half by slipping the ball under the keeper leaving it 4-1 at halftime.

Turramurra continued to threaten in the second half, testing the keeper and hitting the woodwork, however they were unable to hit the back of the net. Whilst the boys in defence stood strong to see the game finish up 4-1 and see Turramurra move onto the quarter finals.
