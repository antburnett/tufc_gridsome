The Grass Roots Course was run last night at Ku-Ring-Gai High School by Nick Mountford.  There were 21 attendees, mainly from TUFC, but also from West Pymble FC, Prouille FC, Asquith FC, Lane Cove FC and some Northern Tigers girls.

All participants walked away more knowing more about coaching than when they walked in.  A big thank you to Nick for his efforts which were appreciated by all!
