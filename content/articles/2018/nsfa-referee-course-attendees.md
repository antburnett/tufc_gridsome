On February 17 the Club was able to send four youth players on the NSFA Referee Course. It was made possible by a grant from Sydney Water.

We had three Under 15s, and an Under 18 in attendance.

Another youth player is attending the course on April 8.

Hopefully, we can now make use of these five newly qualified referees in Season 2018!
