Club sponsor [Chadwick Real Estate](https://turramurraunited.com.au/sponsors/chadwick-real-estate/) is conducting a new event for Turramurra United members.

They're inviting Club members to participate in this strategic event whereby a selection of quality homes will be put under the hammer at their special Auction Spotlight evening. With the Sydney housing market receding from 2017/18 peak it’s more important than ever that vendors showcase their property and use the best platforms available to achieve the highest price.

If you’ve been considering selling or if 2018 didn’t deliver you a sale, this is the opportunity to showcase your property.

By joining you’ll receive a volume discount on the auction fees and complimentary digital marketing services that will save you money. All the good stuff is in the [attached PDF](https://turramurraunited.com.au/wp-content/uploads/Spotlight-May-2019-optimised.pdf)!
