**Turramurra United Football Club awarded 2020 NSFA SAP League licence**

As we seek to improve the development of our junior players, TUFC is delighted to announce we have been successful in our application to the North Shore Football Association (NSFA) for a Skills Acquisition Phase (SAP) League licence in 2020.

**What does this mean for our junior players at TUFC?** This means that in 2020 TUFC will have a team in each of the age groups U8-U11 playing in the NSFA SAP League. The SAP League will act as the top division of NSFA community football in the U8-U11 age groups.

**What if my child doesn’t make or doesn’t want to try out for a SAP team?** Community football is our main focus at TUFC and we will continue to run as many teams as we can to serve players in the U8 to U11 age group, especially those who just want to play with their friends.

**What’s next?** We welcome the NSFA’s decision to award Turramurra United FC a SAP license. Planning is already underway to organise November trials for interested players – stay tuned for more information!
