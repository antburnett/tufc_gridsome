The TUFC Charity Awareness Day is on the 13 April and is a celebration of the continuing sponsorship of [RUOK](https://www.ruok.org.au/) and [Cardiac Arrest Survival Foundation](http://www.cardiacarrest.org.au/) by the Club and specifically the Men's teams.

On the day some of the Menâ€™s teams playing will be wearing a charity shirt as part of our support to these charities.
