Our Platinum Sponsor [Chadwick Real Estate](https://turramurraunited.com.au/sponsors/chadwick-real-estate/) invites you to participate in their 2019 Spotlight event.

With the Sydney housing market receding from the 2017/18 peak it is more important than ever that vendors showcase their property and use the best platforms available to achieve the highest sale price.   

If you’ve been considering selling or if 2018 didn’t deliver you a sale, this is the opportunity to showcase your property.  

Bonus’ include:

- Complimentary Advanced Digital Marketing Package
- Reduced Auction Fee
- Chadwick Targeted Database Marketing
- North Shore Times EVENT Promotional Ad
- Chinese Property Weekly Event Promotional Ad

Call one of their offices today to discuss:

- Killara 8401 0400

We thank Chadwick Real Estate for their sponsorship of Turramurra United Football Club.
