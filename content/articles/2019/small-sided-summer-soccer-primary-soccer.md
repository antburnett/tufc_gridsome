**Small Sided Summer Soccer now open for registrations!**

As the end of the winter football season is approaching parents may be wondering about summer football opportunities. There is no full-field summer competition, but there are several 5-a-side competitions in the area.

**We recommend [www.primarysoccer.com.au](http://www.primarysoccer.com.au/) Summer Soccer.** This runs like a cooperative between many of the clubs in the area. Profits are returned to clubs based on the number of participants.

It's a local comp which allows the kids to set up their own teams and play 'fun, friendly soccer'. It's a great opportunity for the kids to play with their buddies in a kit of their choice and in a team they put together and named themselves!

So, **when registering,  remember to mention our club** (**Turramurra United FC**).

For $150 you can play one afternoon a week at locations like Wahroonga, Turramurra, St Ives for a 15 week season ending in February. Team registrations have just opened so now is the time to talk to team mates to get a group of 5 or 6 together. You can register as an individual and be placed in a team or register as a team, players are not graded so you can stay with your friends.

- It caters for all ages up to 15 and also has a weekend women’s competition.
- All games have qualified referees.
- Teams are graded so your opponents are of similar ability.
- Primary Soccer does accept the $100 NSW Active Kids Voucher. ($100 discount of your summer activities)

If you wish to enter a team, now is the time to talk to friends and team mates and register at [www.primarysoccer.com.au](http://www.primarysoccer.com.au/)

Don't forget to mention your club is **Turramurra United FC**.

PS. This year children qualify for two Active Kids Vouchers ($100 discount on each registration - as long as providers accept these vouchers).
