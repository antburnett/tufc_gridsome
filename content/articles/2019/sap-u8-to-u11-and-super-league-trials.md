## **SAP (U8 to U11) and Super League Trials – mark your calendars & register today!**

 

As a community football club committed to play our part in the growth and development of our young players, Turramurra United FC  is delighted to announce the trial dates for our SAP and Super League Teams in 2020

 

**What if my child doesn’t make or doesn’t want to try out for a SAP or Super League team?** Community football is our main focus at TUFC and we will continue to run as many teams as we can to serve players in the SAP & Super League age groups, especially those who just want to play with their friends.

**Do I need to pay for my child to register for SAP or Super League trials?** No, there is no fee required to attend trials. However when the teams are selected, a deposit will be required to save a place in a team.

**I would like my child to try out for the Turramurra United SAP or Super League team. When are the trials and how do I register?** Please mark your calendars and register for TUFC SAP & Super League trials from the registration links provided below and we will stay in touch to keep you updated with reminders as we get closer to the trial dates.

 

**Got a question?** Kindly send any questions in relation to TUFC SAP or Super League trials to Mark Bendall at [president@turramurraunited.com.au](mailto:president@turramurraunited.com.au) .
