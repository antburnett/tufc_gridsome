Just a reminder that Turramurra United’s first grading day for 2019 will be taking place this Sunday 10th February at Karuah Oval.  There have been a few changes made to the schedule, so please check the time you are required, and please arrive 15 minutes before the applicable start time to sign-in.  

U9 & GU9                                         9:00 – 10:00  

U10 & GU10                                     10:00 – 11:00  

U11                                                    11:00 – 12:00  

U12, GU11 & GU12                        12:00 – 1:00  

U13 & U14                                       1:00 – 2:00  

We will not be running grading this Sunday for G14, G16 and U15, as the current registration numbers indicate that there will only be one team in those age groups. In U16 there will be two teams, but the 16A team was graded when we held Super League trials last November, and the other players who have registered will form the 16B team. We may hold a session on Sunday 17th February for these age groups – we will advise by email during next week.  

Players **cannot wear boots**, because Council does not allow boots on most grass fields during the cricket season. But shinpads must be worn. Please ensure that you have enough water or energy drink to keep your son or daughter hydrated, and sunscreen should be worn.      

The grading sessions this week will focus on 1 v 1, 2 v 2 and small sided games.  

Please note that the BBQ will be running and we will be selling club shorts, socks and other gear.
