As the new year is welcomed, it is a good time to know that registrations for Turramurra United Football Club will be opening soon!

We'll announce further details soon, but maybe now is a time to start bringing those foot skills up to scratch, and even some fitness!

> **Update: 9 January:** Please note that registrations for 2019 will open on Monday 14th January.  FNSW have implemented a new registration system for 2019, and details of how to register and a link will be sent out in due course.

> **Update: 14 January @** **12:45pm****:** Unfortunately, the opening of registrations for the 2019 season has been delayed, this is due to a number of faults in the system that need to be rectified by FNSW.  This situation is out of our control and until the bugs are fixed by FNSW registrations cannot open, we hope to be able to open registrations early next week at the latest.

> Thanks for your patience and we will keep you updated and advise you once registrations have opened.
