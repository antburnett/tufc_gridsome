Last night marked the final training session of the season for our U16B’s before their BIG ‘GF’ game on Saturday – the team wanted to say a BIG THANK YOU to **Ally Brown** of XLR8 who made training fun and non-stop right throughout the season –

U16B’S finished in 4th place, with a 1-0 win against table toppers Mount Colah in last weekend’s semi they head towards this weekend’s GF full of beans and ready to go! Thanks XLR8!

It was an early start this morning at Parklands as our U16B’s faced Div 2 Premiers Mount Colah in the U16 Division 2 semi-final. Attempting to be the first TUFC team to make it to a Grand Final this season, the B’s battled hard and took the lead after Barney Clark rounded the keeper to fire home in the first half. A determined and composed second half team display led by the Virgil van Dijk like Matt Brennan and our safest hands in soccer, James Bell saw the team make it through with a clean sheet and look forward to a Grand Final match-up with Lindfield.
