The Turramurra United U18B team, comprised of players from both TUFC and Sacred Heart Pymble as a joint venture, won the NSFA U18 division 3 competition in 2019 on goal difference from St Ives B (both teams finished on 46 points, but TUFC had a better goal difference, having scored exactly 100 goals during the season).

On Saturday 7 September TUFC took on St Ives in the U18 division 3 grand final at NTRA. It was a very windy morning, and although we had beaten St Ives 4-0 and drawn 2-2 during the season, they adapted better to the blustery conditions and took a 2-0 lead after scoring twice midway through the first half. Luckily, just before halftime Jeremy Robson pulled once back for TUFC, who went in to the break down 2-1.  In a tight second half there was no score until about the 60 minute mark, when a lovely corner from Nick Bendall was nodded home by Jeremy (his 34th goal of the season) to level things up.

The remainder of the second half was tight – Jeremy almost had a winner but was thwarted by the St Ives goalie but in turn Matt, the TUFC goalie, bravely saved at the feet of a St Ives player. Normal time finished 2-2 so extra time was played.

The first 15 minutes couldn’t separate the teams but after 3 minutes of the second period of extra time Isaac Riggs struck from about 30 metres out: 3-2 to Turra!

  

Well done to the  team on doing the double after a very enjoyable and successful season.
