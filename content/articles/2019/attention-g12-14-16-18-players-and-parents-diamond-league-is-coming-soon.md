**Diamond League trials – register now**

Turramurra United FC and Kissing Point FC are committed to the development of young female players, and we are delighted to announce a successful joint venture in gaining a Diamond League Licence for 2020.

Diamond League is for U12, U14, U16 and U18 girls who wish to play in the top division of NSFA community football, and provides the opportunity for depth and development.

**Diamond League Teams will receive:**

- XLR8 training and gameday coach
- 2 nights a week training during the season
- At least 22 weeks of training (including pre-season)
- At least 17 weeks of matches (+ pre-season trial games)
- Dedicated female coaching coordinator
- An XLR8 training shirt and a TUFC Super League jacket

**Why a joint venture?**

Both clubs are committed to female football, sit alongside each other geographically, and recognise that Diamond League needs to be a quality league with competitive teams. By combining forces, both clubs can enable current players to remain at their clubs and play at this level, as well as attract new players. With the backing of dedicated committee members working on female football, the two clubs aim to increase female participation in football.

**What if my daughter doesn’t make or doesn’t want to try out for a Diamond League team?**

Your daughter will still be able to play community football at her club in 2020. The aim is to provide for both community players and girls who wish to progress within the NSFA. Both clubs will continue to run as many teams as they can to serve female players, including those who want to play social football with friends.
