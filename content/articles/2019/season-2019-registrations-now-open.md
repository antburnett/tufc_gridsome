There have been some teething problems with the new registration system that Football NSW have set up, but most of those issues appear to have been fixed (although there may still be some issue with registration for senior footballers).  We have decided to open for registrations now despite the remaining issues because it is only 3 weeks until the first of our junior grading days and we need players to start registering.

The new registration site is PlayFootball - [www.playfootball.com.au](http://www.playfootball.com.au/)  

You can click on one of the links below to go directly to the Turramurra United registration page:

### SENIOR REGISTRATION (MAA, WAA, WO30 6-s-side, WO35, M35 & M45)

### Important Notes

Please note the following. When you are given an option to select the “Available registration products”, select “Player, “Club Football” and “Community” respectively. You will then be asked to select the relevant age group to register in. Unfortunately, the registration fee that appears next to some age groups is not correct (don’t ask us why – that is one of the FNSW system issues). However, the correct registration fee _does_ appear once you have selected the age group (and before you are required to pay). 

All players U12 and above must upload a photograph when registering – the photos on the previous registration system have not been transferred across by FNSW.

Please note that payment must be made online by credit card at the time of registration.  The registration fee for 2019 covers the following:

- NSFA Facilities Levy of $16.50 (inc. GST) per player (applies to every player in NSFA)
- Up to 18 weeks of professional weeknight coaching for U6 to U16 (heavily subsidised by the Club)
- Ground hire for training and for pre-season
- Training equipment for coaches
- Registration for NSFA competition
- Insurance
- Affiliation fees to NSFA, Football NSW and FFA (which are not all shown on the fee breakdown on the FNSW registration site)
- Playing shirts (to be returned at end of season)
- Trophies for juniors (U6-U16 years)
- Referee fees for competition games
- The fee is GST inclusive

If you have a child not over 18 enrolled in full-time education, you may apply for the Active Kids Voucher and this can be redeemed during registration ($100 will be deducted from your fee). You have to enter the voucher number in the field called “Voucher” to have the rebate applied to reduce the fee payable. Further information about the Active Kids Voucher can be found at [https://sport.nsw.gov.au/sectordevelopment/activekids](https://sport.nsw.gov.au/sectordevelopment/activekids)

There is a small student discount for Men’s and Women’s All Age players who are still in full-time education.
