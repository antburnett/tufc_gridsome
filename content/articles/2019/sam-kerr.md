The Turramurra United Premier League women’s team got a fantastic message from the best of the best to kick off their season, after the “tigers” as they are known, got promoted this year.

Never fear, TUFC made sure our juniors girls also got the inspiring message from our Matilda’s captain, Sam Kerr. The surprise and joy was wonderful to see!

TUFC have 13 female teams this year ranging from GU9 to WO35, in addition to many girls playing mixed. Bring on the World Cup in June!
