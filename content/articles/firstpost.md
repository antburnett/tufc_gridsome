## Further Update on 2020 Season

Hi everyone,

You should all by now have received emails from FFA and NSFA regarding the further delay to the start of the football season. Whilst this is not an ideal scenario, please do not despair as we are all hoping that we will play some football this season. If the season does start from 1 June, we may be able to play throughout the July holidays to the end of August and possibly into September, giving us what could be at least a 12-week season. NSFA and TUFC are continuing to work behind the scenes to prepare for the season, in the hope that our MiniRoos players through to our senior teams will be able to get out on the football fields and enjoy playing football once again.

Please do not try to deregister at this stage, as if the season does go ahead our teams will need to be finalised and ready to go and losing players may put teams in jeopardy. Our volunteer committee are preparing for all scenarios, so that we are ready once confirmation about how the season is to proceed. Please note that any deregistering/refund process is not automated. We will not start to process any refunds until we know when or if the season will commence. TUFC is in line with NSFA in respect to the communication regarding registrations and refunds, as set out in the paragraph below.

As in previous communication, we ask our football community to maintain their football registration for season 2020. By retaining your registration, you are helping TUFC and NSFA staff plan accordingly which is extremely important to be consistent during these times, particularly whilst working alongside external stakeholders. TUFC can also assure you that pro-rata refunds will be provided once we know what the impact upon the length of the season will be. As you would appreciate, further information is required prior to NSFA and TUFC confirming what this may look like. We are working with FFA, Football NSW, the insurance company and the NSFA to fully understand this situation.

Anita will be sending out further emails to those teams who do not yet have a coach or manager, so please do think about volunteering for a role for your childâ€™s team.

In the meantime, please keep up your football skills, both of our training partners are supporting and maximising ways to keep involved in football:

XLR8 have set up their own Youtube channel, where you can watch and participate in football skills challenges, such as juggling, side rolls and toe taps - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8TI4yoIf-fnCeAAfrJMu5g/. You can also stay connected with the NSFA through their Facebook page - XLR8 Player Development

T3 Australia have a lunchtime exercise program through Facebook live and plenty of videos to run through with your children. Facebook Page: Thursday Lunch Time PE & Soccer With T3

Remember we are all in this together, and together we will soon be back playing the World Game. Stay safe and well during this time.
