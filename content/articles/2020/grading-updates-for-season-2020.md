The first TUFC grading day for mixed and girls U10, U11 and U12 players will take place on Sunday 16th February and Sunday 23rd February at Karuah.

Please note that SAP, Development Squad and Super League/Diamond League players who were graded in November are not required to attend the grading sessions because they are already allocated to their teams.

The schedule is as follows

- U10: 9:00 – 10:00
- U11 , G10, G11, G12: 10:15 – 11:15
- U12: 11:30 – 12:30

In relation to the three girls age groups – the current number of registrations indicate that we may only have one team for each age group but we ask that the girls who have registered attend to meet teammates and go through some drills in case we get further registrations and have more than one team in an age group.

Please arrive at least 15 minutes before the assigned start time.

Please also note that we have two spots to fill in both the U10 and U12 Development Squads. If your son or daughter is interested please email [sec@turramurraunited.com.au](mailto:sec@turramurraunited.com.au) and/or call Mark Bendall (SAP/Super League Coordinator) on 0425 304 176. We will grade the players who express interest so that we can fill those spots.

**Players should NOT wear football boots, but must wear shin pads. Bring water and, if it is warm, sunscreen.**

Gear (socks, shorts, fleeces, hoodies) will be on sale during the grading sessions, and a BBQ will be running all morning.

There will be a second grading day on Sunday 23 February at Karuah which will continue the grading process from the first grading day.

In relation to the U13-U18 age groups – registration numbers indicate that these age groups will only have one team plus the Super League and/or development squads that were graded and formed in November. We will advise if any grading sessions are required if there is a change in registration numbers.

U6-U9 team allocation will occur on Sunday 8 March.
