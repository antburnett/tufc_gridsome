Whilst traditional football is on hold, we want players to enjoy themselves, continue their development and fall in love with the ball. Each week the NSFA/XLR8 will be releasing two skill videos and a weekly football challenge on their social media channels for players to practice at home, in order to stay active and improve their technical football skills whilst training and matches are postponed

The NSFA/XLR8 have released the Juggling Challenge for this week for all players within the NSFA. They want to see which club can have the most players actively involved in this, tracking their scores each week and making improvements in their juggling!

At the core of our XLR8 Home Skills Series, is our want for people to stay active and healthy whilst at home during this trying period, and we believe with a ball at your feet this can be achieved.

Good luck, good health and happy juggling!
