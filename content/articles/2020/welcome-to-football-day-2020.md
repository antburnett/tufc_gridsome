**Welcome to Football Day** is about getting the children on the park again and kicking the ball. This coming Sunday’s session (March 8, 2020) will be run by one of our training partners – T3 - at Karuah Park, Turramurra.

T3 Australia is responsible for our season training for the age groups U6 through to the U9s.

Our BBQ will be running and there will be a coffee van.

You will also be able to purchase Kit on the day. Don’t forget your small change for the BBQ. We will have an EFTPOS machine for kit purchase.

Age time slots are below. Please arrive 15 minutes prior to your session.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The teams the players are allocated at Welcome to Football Day will not necessarily be the final teams.

The committee is working on finalising teams, so please forward your "play with requests" to [secretary@turramurraunited.com.au](mailto:secretary@turramurraunited.com.au), if you did not do so online when registering. Please be specific i.e.: "I wish to play with John Smith", or "I wish to play in the same team as last year- U8 Sharks". This allows the committee to organise teams easily. We will likely use last years teams as a basis for the teams, so if you would prefer to change teams, please also advise us of this via email to info@turramurraunited.com.au.

The last day for play with requests will be next Sunday 8th March, to ensure all the teams are organised in time for the season.

Looking forward to seeing you on Sunday!
